#A small app to enable the parsing of text into a more dyslexic friendly format.
#Concept is to allow user to drop in file and then we parse that and embolden the first couple of letters of each word.


#Create  markdown
#parse input into markdown
#Format in text file
#output back to the user
#once functionality is complete, create a nice UI

#for i in text:
    #if i.length <=2 bold first char
    #if i.length == 3 bold first 2 char
    #else bold 3 chars

def dyslexicNoMore(text):
    newtext = text
